 */

 */

 * exponent character).
 */
#define RTERR_INVREAL   -12

/**
 * String overflow.  This status code is returned when a fixed-sized
 * field is being decoded as specified by a size constraint and
 * the item contains more characters or bytes then this amount.  It
 * can occur when a run-time function is called with a fixed-sixed
 * static buffer and whatever operation is being done causes the
 * bounds of this buffer to be exceeded.
 */
#define RTERR_STROVFLW  -13

/**
 * Bad value. This status code is returned anywhere where an API is
 * expecting a value to be within a certain range and it not within
 * this range.  An example is the encoding or decoding date values
 * when the month or day value is not within the legal range (1-12 for
 * month and 1 to whatever the max days is for a given month).

 * size, and permitted alphabet constraints.
 */
#define RTERR_CONSVIO   -16

/**
 * Unexpected end-of-file error.  This status code is returned when an
 * unexpected end-of-file condition is detected on decode.  It is similar

 */
#define RTERR_OUTOFBND  -19

/**
 * Invalid parameter passed to a function of method.  This status code is
 * returned by a function or method when it does an initial check on the
 * values of parameters passed in.  If a parameter is found to not have a
 * value in the expected range, this error code is returned.
 */
#define RTERR_INVPARAM  -20

/**
 * Invalid value format.  This status code is returned when a value is
 * received or passed into a function that is not in the expected format.

 */

/**
 * Context not initialized.  This status code is returned when the
 * run-time context structure (OSCTXT) is attempted to be used without
 * having been initialized.  This can occur if rtxInitContext is not
 * invoked to initialize a context variable before use in any other API
 * call.  It can also occur is there is a license violation (for example,
 * evaluation license expired).
 */
#define RTERR_NOTINIT   -22

/**
 * Value will not fit in target variable.  This status is returned by
 * the decoder when a target variable is not large enough to hold a
 * a decoded value.  A typical case is an integer value that is too
 * large to fit in the standard C integer type (typically a 32-bit value)
 * on a given platform.  If this occurs, it is usually necessary to use
 * a configuration file setting to force the compiler to use a different
 * data type for the item.  For example, for integer, the \<isBigInteger/\>
 * setting can be used to force use of a big integer type.
 */
#define RTERR_TOOBIG    -23

/**
 * Invalid character.  This status code is returned when a character is
 * encountered that is not valid for a given data type.  For example,

 */
#define RTERR_XMLSTATE  -25

/**
 * XML parser error.  This status code in returned when the underlying

/**
 * Sequence order error.  This status code is returned when decoding

 * print the details of the error contained within the context
 * variable.
 */
#define RTERR_REGEXP    -34

/**
 * Pattern match error.  This status code is returned by the decoder
 * when a value in an XML instance does not match the pattern facet
 * defined in the XML schema.  It can also be returned by numeric encode
 * functions that cannot format a numeric value to match the pattern
 * specified for that value.
